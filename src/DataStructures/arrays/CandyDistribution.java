/**
 * There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.
 * <p>
 * You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
 * Each child must have at least one candy.
 * Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
 * What is the minimum candies you must give?
 * <p>
 * Sample Input :
 * <p>
 * Ratings : [1 2]
 * Sample Output :
 * 3
 * The candidate with 1 rating gets 1 candy and candidate with rating cannot get 1 candy as 1 is its neighbor.
 * So rating 2 candidate gets 2 candies. In total, 2+1 = 3 candies need to be given out.
